README for sttyl

  Student: Matthew Thomas
  Date: 3/16/2019

Summary:

This submission contains the files:
	README       -- this file
	sttyl.c      -- all logic to retrieve, update, and show tty settings
	Plan         -- design document for this assignment
	Makefile     -- the Makefile
	my_script.sh -- my sample test script, including a run of the lib215 script
	typescript   -- a sample run, performed using my_script.sh

Notes:
	Several functions, or parts of functions, were copied from samples
	provided in the lecture files. When this code has been used, a note on the
	source appears in the function comments. Any modifications were made by me.
	For the getbaud() function, I used values from the Open Group standards
	page, which is link in the comments. Other ideas were taken from section
	meetings, and a Piazza post. These contributions are also noted where they
	occur.
	
	I wrote my code using a combination of BBEdit on the Mac, and server-side
	editing using Emacs. Indentation is 4-space wide tabs. With 4-space tabs,
	all lines should be under 80-cols wide.
