==================================================
Project: sttyl

Purpose: Set a limited number of options for a terminal device interface.

Outline:
	sttyl with no arguments will print the current values for options
	it knows about. Special characters you can change are erase and
	kill. Other attributes can be turned on using the name, or turned
	off by adding a '-' before the attribute. See the Arguments section
	below for examples.

Arguments:
	sttyl accepts arguments for the following flags:

			icrnl, hupcl, echo, echoe, opost, icanon, and isig
	
	Flag arguments with a leading dash, '-', will turn that flag OFF for the
	tty. Flag arguments without a leading dash, will turn that flag ON. The
	following command line, for example, will turn "echo" and "icanon" ON,
	and turn "hupcl" OFF.
	
			./sttyl echo icanon -hupcl
	
	sttyl also accepts arguments for the following control chars:

			erase and kill
			
	These arguments take a proceeding value of a single char that is used to
	replace the control char. The following command line, for example, will
	set "erase" to 'm' and "kill" to '^X'
	
			./sttyl erase m kill ^X
	
	The real stty accepts two-char values in the form of caret-letter, such as
	"^X". In the command line above, '^X' was obtained by pressing Control-X
	on the keyboard, as opposed to the '^' caret char AND the 'X' char. As
	mentioned in bullet #2 of the assignment, this implementation is not
	required to handle this case, and it does not.
	
	sttyl accepts multiple arguments on a single command line (as in the
	examples above). sttyl also accepts no arguments, and will print info
	about the tty in this case. See the "Output" section below for what
	info it outputs.

Output:
	When setting values for control characters or flags, sttyl has no output.
	If there is an invalid or missing argument, a message will be output to
	stderr.
	
	When sttyl is called with no arguments, sttyl will output basic info
	about the tty. The info it prints includes the speed, size of the tty,
	control chars, and state of all flags. The output is modeled after the
	implementation of stty on macOS, which includes the flag-type as a
	header -- e.g. "lflags: ..." -- in the output. On the nice servers,
	stty does not output those "headers", but the flags are still sorted
	by type.

Data Structures:
	sttyl is a table-driven program. Two structs are defined in sttyl.c: one
	for the four flag types, and one for the special characters. Both tables
	store the symbolic constant and the name of the associated flag or char.
	The table_t struct for flags also stores a string of the type -- iflag,
	oflag, cflag, and lflag -- and the offset value to find where the bit
	mask is located in a termios struct.
	
	Two arrays, one for the four flag types and one for the special
	characters, contain one struct per flag or char and are declared in the
	same sttyl.c file.
	
	The method of using an offset value in the table is taken from Brandon
	Williams' section on 2019-03-13. An offset is used to avoid the need of
	a global termios struct and can be adapted to be used with any termios
	struct. This offset value is used to construct a pointer to the correct
	tcflag_t field for a given flag. To get the pointer, multiple casts are
	required, and this is done in the show_flagset() and get_option()
	functions. The specifics vary slightly depending on the function, but the
	basics are as follows (again, copied from Brandon's section notes):
	
		tcflag_t * mode_p = (tcflag_t *)((char *)(info) + offset_val);
			
	First, "info", which is the address of the termios struct holding the
	terminal settings, is cast as a char *. This is to make adding the
	offset_val (which is an unsigned long), move the correct number of bytes.
	At this stage, we have the address of the tcflag_t, and can cast it as
	a tcflag_t *.
	
	Storing the flags and chars in these tables makes printing or changing
	the values easy to do. Printing, done by show_charset() and
	show_flagset(), loops through each table until the end, signified by the
	NULL in the "name" member, and processing the data accordingly. To turn
	a flag on or off, or set a special character, the same for loop is done
	until a matching struct is found.

Algorithms:
	Printing:
	To print the list of special characters and flags, show_flagset() and
	show_charset() are used. Both iterate through the table (flags) and
	cchars (special characters) arrays respectively.
	
	In show_flagset(), the offset value stored in the array is cast to a
	tcflag_t pointer. When dereferenced, this provides the correct flag
	values to compare with the current symbolic constant. For example,
	in the "echo" entry, the offset will point to the c_lflag value in
	the termios struct which can be bit-wise-and'ed with the symbolic
	constant ECHO. If the bit-wise AND equals the constant, than the flag
	is on. Otherwise, a leading dash is added to the output.
	
	In show_charset(), the symbolic constant stored in the c_value member
	servers as the index-offset for the c_cc[] in the termios struct. To
	correctly display the char stored there, two special cases are taken
	into consideration. If the value equals _POSIX_VDISABLE, that special
	character is not used and "<undef>" is printed. Otherwise, if the char
	is a control character, as determined by iscntrl(), it is printed in
	a two-char caret-letter representation. To obtain the letter portion,
	the value is XORed with the constant CHAR_MASK which is 64, or the
	ASCII value of '@'. In practice, this adds 64 to ASCII values 0-31 and
	subtracts 64 from value 127, the DEL char (this idea was mentioned in
	Piazza post @171). In all other cases, the chars are printable ASCII
	and output as-is.
	
	Updating:
	There is no special algorithm used to update a special character. As
	long as there is a second argument presented, and that argument is
	a one-character ASCII value, it will be assigned to the appropriate
	index in the termios c_cc[] array.
	
	For flags, a similar process is followed to the printing steps. The
	offset value stored in the array is cast to a tcflag_t pointer which
	is used to perform the correct bitwise operation. To turn a flag on,
	the correct c_*flag value in the termios struct is bitwise-ORed (|=)
	with the symbolic constant. To turn a flag off, the c_*flag value is
	bitwise-ANDed with the one's-complement of the symbolic constant.
	

Program Flow:
	1 - Load the terminal settings in to a termios struct.
	2 - If there are no command-line arguments, print the current values
		for the flags and chars. See Algorithms above, for more info.
	3 - If there are arguments, loop through and process them accordingly.
		First check for a special character, erase and kill are supported.
		This also requires an ASCII char as a second argument. Otherwise,
		see if it matches a supported flag. If these criteria are met,
		update the flag or char and move on to the next (see Algorithms
		and Data Structures for how the updating takes place). If any of
		the arguments are not valid, print an error message and quit the
		program (see Error Handling for more).
	4 - After processing command-line arguments, apply the changes back
		to the termios struct and return.

Error Handling:
	sttyl can run into an error due to a bad system call or invalid user
	argument input.
	
	System calls:
	Calls when getting or setting terminal settings, tcgetattr(),
	tcsetattr(), cfgetospeed(), and ioctl(), may all produce an error. These
	functions will return -1 and set errno according to the man page. An error
	will most likely occur due to the file descriptor not being valid, or a
	valid tty.
	
	Invalid input:
	When processing command-line arguments, there are three situations where
	invalid input can occur:
		1) the special character (erase or kill) is missing an argument
		2) the argument given for the special character is non-ASCII or
		   not a single character
		3) it is not a special character, or a recognized flag argument.
	In each of these cases, a corresponding error message is output (with
	the offending value given on the command line), and the program exits 1.
